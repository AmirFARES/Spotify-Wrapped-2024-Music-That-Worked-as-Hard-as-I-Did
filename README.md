## About this Project üåê  

The goal of this project was to craft a **personalized 2024 Spotify Wrapped**, built entirely from my own listening data. By analyzing trends and preferences, this dashboard provides a deeper understanding of how my music choices align with my work habits and overall year.  

### Key Objectives üéØ  

- **Analyze Listening Trends**: Understand how my playtime correlates with significant events like starting a new job.  
- **Showcase Favorites**: Highlight my most and least favorite songs and artists of the year.  
- **Reveal Platform Preferences**: Explore my dominant platforms (spoiler: Windows reigns supreme).  
- **Create a Storytelling Dashboard**: Use Spotify's color palette to design an interactive and visually appealing report.  

## Data Sources üìä  

The data used in this project was directly exported from my personal Spotify account. This involved:  

1. **Exporting JSON Files**: Retrieving my listening data from Spotify.  
2. **Data Transformation**: Converting JSON to **[CSV](https://github.com/AmirFARES/Spotify-Wrapped-2024-Music-That-Worked-as-Hard-as-I-Did/blob/main/data/transformed_data.csv)**, standardizing platform details, and filling missing values with defaults using both **[Python](https://github.com/AmirFARES/Spotify-Wrapped-2024-Music-That-Worked-as-Hard-as-I-Did/blob/main/data/data_transformation.ipynb)** and Power Query.  
3. **Final Input**: Feeding the cleaned and transformed data into Power BI Report part for analysis and visualization.  

## Methodology üöÄ  

This dashboard was built in **Power BI**, leveraging Spotify's **brand colors** for a consistent and engaging design. Here's how the project unfolded:  

1. **Data Preparation**:  
   - Focused on **2024 listening data** only, ensuring relevance to the wrapped theme.  
   - Standardized platform details and filled missing data.  

2. **Key Insights Analysis**:  
   - **Playtime Trends**:  
     Listening resumed in **April 2024** after a break, coinciding with starting my new job. I realized I primarily listen while working, explaining the inactivity in January to March.  
   - **Monthly Playtime**:  
     Analyzed monthly averages (~21 hours/month) and identified **August 2024** as the peak month with 46 hours.  

3. **Music Insights**:  
   - **Favorite Artist**: LXNGVX, with "Montagem Mysterious Game" as the top song.  
   - **Most Skipped Song**: *Cry Me A River* (which deserved a second chance üòÖ).  

4. **Platform Preferences**:  
   Windows usage dominated over macOS and Android, reinforcing my music-at-work habit.
